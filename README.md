# MNIST Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The model is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.


## Introduction
This project uses the MNIST dataset to train a CNN model capable of classifying digits. It includes:
- Preprocessing the dataset by reshaping and normalizing the data.
- Training a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
- Evaluating the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test dataset.
- Visualizing training performance and making predictions.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is:
- 28x28 pixels
- Grayscale (1 channel)
- Labeled with a digit (0-9)
